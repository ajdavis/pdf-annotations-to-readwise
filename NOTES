PyPDF(|2|4) throws ValueError reading "Specifying Systems"
0xabu/pdfannots extracts PDF Expert underlines, it seems, but not "free text annotations" - fixed
    Dies on "2013 SoCC - Consistency without Borders, Bailis.pdf": "No /Root object! - Is this really a PDF?"
    Uses pdfminer lib
pdfrw dies on "Specifying Systems"
pdfreader dies on both
xpdf tools' pdftohml
    On "Specifying Systems" warns that xref table is damaged, my fault? -- YES! Specifying Systems, TLA+ ANNOTATED (2021-07-05 14-36-26).pdf is ok
    Could use this to generate HTML then try to parse the HTML, but annotations are not distinctly marked in the HTML
    Underlines rendered as an image, can't use this

    just for detecting things about the PDF, not navigating the object tree?
pdfbox (Java)
PyMuPDF
    dies on "Specifying Systems" with "cannot understand xref format", works with older version
    OK on "2013 SoCC - Consistency without Borders, Bailis.pdf"
Automator action "Extract PDF Annotations" does FreeText but not underlines, see extract-annotations.workflow
PDF Expert's "Export Annotations" is thorough but requires janky Applescript
Zotero plus Zotfiles, "Extract annotations" feature
    Consistently omits "fi" when extracting underlines from "Specifying Systems", defines -> denes
    Ignores FreeText
skimnotes from the Skim app
    Doesn't find any notes, I guess it only reads notes written with Skim
